# Code examples from teachings fall 2023

## Setup the development environment

### Add the python and jupyter extension in VS Code
1. Open VS Code.
1. Click on the "Extensions" icon in the left sidebar.
1. Search for "python" and install the Python extension from Microsoft.
1. Search for "jupyter" and install the Jupyter extension pack (4) from Microsoft.

### Setting Up the Class Repository in VS Code:

#### 1. Clone the Repository:

* Open VS Code.
* Click the “Source Control” icon on the left (square with a branch).
* Click “Clone Repository”.
* Enter the URL: https://github.com/python-elective-kea/fall2023-code-examples-from-teachings.git
* Choose a local folder to clone to and click “Clone”.

#### 2 .Navigate to the Cloned Repository:

* Click the “Explorer” icon on the left.
* Go to the cloned folder (e.g., fall2023-code-examples-from-teachings).

#### 3. Set Up Git:

* If the Git status bar isn't visible at the bottom-left, click the “Source Control” icon.
* Click the displayed branch name (e.g., “main” or “master”).
* Type “playground” to create a new branch or click “+” and name it “playground”.
* The status bar should now show “playground” as the active branch.

#### 4. Open the File:

* Locate playground.ipynb in the “Explorer” panel.
* Double-click to open it.

#### 5. Set Up Python Environment:

* On the top right corner.
* Select Kernel.
* Choose Python environments.
* Click on Create Python Environment.
* Opt for Venv Create a '.venv' in the current workspace.
* Select your Python version (e.g., 3.11.3).
* This process establishes a ‘.venv’ virtual environment for the playground.ipynb file.

#### 6. Note: 
* Always choose the .venv environment when running code in this repository in the future.

### Working with Code and Exercises for the Semester:

* Always pull the master branch for new files added to the repository.
* Create a new branch for:
   * Playing with files.
   * Completing exercises.
* Never merge your branches into the master branch.

#### Important Note:

* Do not edit files directly in the master branch.
* Keep the master branch clean to avoid merge errors.
